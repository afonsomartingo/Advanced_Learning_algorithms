# Advanced Learning Algorithms

This repository contains programming assignments and materials for the Advanced Learning Algorithms course, which is part of the Machine Learning Specialization. The course focuses on neural networks and deep learning fundamentals.

## Repository Structure

- `C2_W1_Assignment.ipynb`: Week 1 programming assignment covering neural network basics
- `C2_W2_Assignment.ipynb`: Week 2 programming assignment focusing on multiclass classification and neural networks for handwritten digit recognition
- `autils.py`: Utility functions for assignments
- `utils.py`: Additional utility functions
- `lab_utils_common.py`: Common laboratory utilities
- `lab_utils_softmax.py`: Utilities specific to softmax implementation
- `public_tests.py`: Test functions for assignments
- `deeplearning.mplstyle`: Matplotlib style configuration for plots

## Main Topics Covered

- Neural Networks fundamentals
- ReLU Activation functions
- Softmax and multiclass classification
- TensorFlow implementation
- Handwritten digit recognition
- Deep learning concepts and implementation

## Requirements

The assignments use the following Python packages:
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) to start working on the assignments

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used in assignments
- `images/`: Contains images used in notebooks
- `logs/`: Log files directory
- `archive/`: Archived materials
- `__pycache__/`: Python cache files
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/`: Jupyter notebook checkpoints

## Note

This repository contains assignments that are part of a larger Machine Learning Specialization. The code and materials are designed for educational purposes and include guided implementations of various machine learning concepts.

## Style Guide

The repository includes a custom matplotlib style file (`deeplearning.mplstyle`) for consistent visualization throughout the assignments.
